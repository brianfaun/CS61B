Q: Is one GrowList implementation always better than the others?
A: Yes. The JavaGrow list method is consistently the most efficient at adding elements to a list. Conversely, ArithGrow is
consistently the least efficient in adding new elements.

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a geometrically resizing list a Theta(N) operation?
A: Each time the array becomes full, the size is double, and insertion continues until the array is full again.
Because of this, insertion time is going to be roughly equal to the number of elements being inserted.

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a arithmetically resizing list a Theta(N^2) operation?
A: Each time the array becomes full, the array is increased by 1, the ENTIRE array is copied, and the process repeats.  Clearly,
inserting N elements will is a Theta(n^2) operation because for each element added, the copy must go through each element
already in the list to copy successfully.

Q: How does the runtime per operation for the ArithGrowList compare to that of GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList? Specifically look at the non-accumulated plots and describe the trends for how long each operation takes as a function of how many elements have already been inserted in the list.
A: The runtime for ArithGrowList is the largest, while GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList are significantly quicker.
ArithGrowList increases as the number of elements increases (with spikes), while the other two remain extremely small,
 with only a few large jumps.

Q: When are there spikes in the per operation runtime graphs for each of the implementations? Do these make sense to you? Hint: some of these should and others might not. Empirical runtime can be quite messy and depends on machine specifics which will be revealed in other subsequent classes like CS61C.
A: The spikes occur when the array needs to be re-sized to fit new elements. For ArithGrow this occurs for every single addition.
 For the other two, this also occurs when the array needs to be re-sized, but the re-sizing is done in a way that it does not
 need to be done again until 2N elements have been added.  This is best seen in the 1024 100 -noaccum graph, where javaGrow spikes
 at intervals of 2N quite consistently.

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for GeomGrowList to resize by a different factor. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
