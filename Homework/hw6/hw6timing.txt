BSTStringSet: 2.41 s
ECHashStringSet: 0.22 s
TreeSet: 2.37 s
HashSet: 0.79 s

1c. Does your ECHashStringSet look roughly linear or roughly quadratic
in its scaling behavior for random strings?
ECHashStringset looks roughly linear for its scaling behavior from one million to two million.

2c. Does your **BST**StringSet look roughly linear or roughly
quadratic in its scaling behavior for in order strings?
BSTStringSet looks roughy quadratic when inserting in order, as opposed to when inserting in random.


Before submitting, make sure that your ECHashStringSet is capable of
handling inputs of size 1000000 in a reasonable amount of time (a few
seconds).
